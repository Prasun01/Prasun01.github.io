Photography Portfolio Website
This is the repository for my personal photography portfolio website, designed to showcase my work in a clean, modern, and engaging way. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and it dynamically pulls all of my photos from my Unsplash profile.

Live Demo: https://prasun01.github.io/

‚ú® Features
Dynamic Unsplash Gallery: Automatically fetches and displays all photos from a specified Unsplash username.

"Load More" Functionality: Images are loaded progressively for better performance, allowing visitors to browse the entire collection without initial long load times.

Modern Masonry Layout: A "Pinterest-style" grid that elegantly displays photos of various aspect ratios.

Interactive Lightbox: Click on any photo to view it in a beautiful, full-screen overlay.

Responsive Design: Looks great on all devices, from large desktops to mobile phones.

Smooth Animations: Subtle animations and hover effects provide a polished and professional user experience.

Minimalist UI: The design is clean and focused, ensuring the photography is the main attraction.
